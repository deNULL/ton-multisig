// Messages for the multisig wallet are signed two times.
// First, the actual request to be sent. Second, the whole message (including the request and signatures from other owners).
// The whole message can be signed by any owner (in practice, by the last one who added a signature).
// However, that means that his signature will be sent two times (thats 256 bits for pubkey + 512 bits for the signature).
// We can reduce the size of the message if we remove his signature from the list of request's signatures
// and leave only the outer one. This contract is smart enough to still count him as a signatory for this request.
// The downside is that afterwards people won't be able to add their signatures, so this script should be performed right
// before sending the message (however this is optional step).
